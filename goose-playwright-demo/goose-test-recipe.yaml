title: Playwright CLI Skill Demo Test
description: Test example.com navigation using Playwright CLI skill

prompt: |
  Use the Playwright CLI skill (summon playwright-cli skill) to automate a browser test.
  The playwright-cli binary is at: /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli
  
  Please run these shell commands in sequence and report what each one outputs:

  Step 1 - Open browser:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli open https://example.com -s goosedemo

  Step 2 - Start tracing:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo tracing-start

  Step 3 - Take snapshot:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo snapshot

  Step 4 - Read the snapshot YAML file that was created to find the ref for the "Learn more" link, then click it:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo click <ref>

  Step 5 - Take snapshot again to verify navigation:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo snapshot

  Step 6 - Stop tracing:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo tracing-stop

  Step 7 - Close browser:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli -s goosedemo close

  Step 8 - Generate and write a Playwright test file to:
  /Users/surbhi/test-automation-platform/goose-playwright-demo/tests/goose-generated-test.spec.ts
  
  The test file should:
  - Import from @playwright/test
  - Navigate to https://example.com
  - Assert the title is "Example Domain"  
  - Click "Learn more" using getByRole('link', { name: 'Learn more' })
  - Assert the URL contains iana.org
  - Assert the title is "Example Domains"
  - Each step should match the exact Playwright code that playwright-cli reported it ran
